This repo is a collection of my Tableau, Power BI projects where I’ve explored real-world datasets, and built dashboards just for the fun of it.


📺 Netflix Dashboard
An interactive dashboard built to analyze Netflix’s content by type, genre, and release trends. A fun exploration of how streaming data can tell a story.
